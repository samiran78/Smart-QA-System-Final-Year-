    "Glove is an alternate approch to build word embeddings using matrix factorization techniques on the word-word co-occurance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large matrix of co-occurrence information is constructed and you count each “word” (the rows), and how frequently we see this word in some “context” (the columns) in a large corpus. Usually, we scan our corpus in the following manner: for each term, we look for context terms within some area defined by a window-size before the term and a window-size after the term. Also, we give less weight for more distant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of “contexts” is, of course, large, since it is essentially combinatorial in size. So then we factorize this matrix to yield a lower-dimensional matrix, where each row now yields a vector representation for each word. In general, this is done by minimizing a “reconstruction loss”. This loss tries to find the lower-dimensional representations which can explain most of the variance in the high-dimensional data."
