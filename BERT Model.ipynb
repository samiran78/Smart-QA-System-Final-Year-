Amazon Redshift RA3 instances\\nallow customers to optimize their data warehouse by scaling and paying for compute and storage independently, so\\nthey can choose the number of instances they need based on their data warehousing workload’s performance\\nrequirements, and only pay for the managed storage that they use; AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon\\nRedshift is a new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache that brings compute to the storage layer, so data doesn’t\\nhave to move back and forth between the two, giving customers up to 10x better query performance than other cloud\\ndata warehouse provider; Amazon Redshift Data Lake Export allows customers to export data directly from Amazon\\nRedshift to Amazon S3 in an open data format optimized for analytics; and Amazon Redshift Federated Query lets\\ncustomers analyze data across their Amazon Redshift data warehouse, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Data\\nLake, and Amazon RDS and Aurora databases.\\n• AWS announced a new innovative highly-scalable, cost-saving warm storage tier for Amazon Elasticsearch Service\\ncalled UltraWarm that makes it easier for customers to retain any amount of current and historical log data at up toone-tenth the current cost and is 80% less than the cost of warm-tier storage from other managed Elasticsearch\\nofferings.\\n• AWS announced Amazon Managed (Apache) Cassandra Service, a scalable, highly available, and fully-managed\\ndatabase service that supports Cassandra workloads. Developers can use the same Cassandra application code, Apache\\n2.0 licensed drivers, and tools as they do today to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon Managed Cassandra\\nService without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. And, because it’s serverless, it also\\nremoves the need to provision, configure, and operate large Cassandra clusters, manually add or remove nodes, and\\nrebalance partitions as traffic scales up or down.\\n• AWS announced three new services and capabilities that make it easier for customers to build and operate securely.\\nAmazon Detective analyzes trillions of data points, using machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to\\nmake it easier to visualize and conduct faster and more efficient security investigations; AWS IAM Access Analyzer\\nmakes it simple for security teams and administrators to audit resource policies for unintended access by analyzing\\nhundreds or even thousands of policies across a customer’s environment in seconds, and delivering detailed findings\\nabout resources that are accessible from outside the account; and AWS Nitro Enclaves is a new Amazon EC2\\ncapability that makes it easy for customers in healthcare, financial services, energy, media and entertainment, and\\nother data-intensive industries to process highly sensitive data, like personally identifiable information and intellectual\\nproperty on their compute instances, particularly from internal threats within their own accounts.\\n• AWS announced that customers can start using AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), making it\\neasier for customers to run Kubernetes applications on AWS. AWS Fargate, which provides serverless computing for\\ncontainers, has substantially changed the way developers manage and deploy their containers. Launched two years ago\\nto work with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate has been broadly requested by Kubernetes\\ncustomers. Now, with AWS Fargate for Amazon EKS, customers can run Kubernetes-based applications on AWS\\nwithout the need to manage servers and clusters.\\n• AWS announced three key initiatives as a part of its plans to help advance quantum computing technologies. Amazon\\nBraket is a new, fully-managed AWS service that enables scientists, researchers, and developers to begin\\nexperimenting with computers from quantum hardware providers (including D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti) in a single\\nplace; AWS Center for Quantum Computing will bring together quantum computing experts from Amazon,\\nthe California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other top academic research institutions to collaborate on the\\nresearch and development of new quantum computing technologies; and the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab connects\\ncustomers with quantum computing experts from Amazon and its partners to develop internal expertise aimed at\\nidentifying practical uses of quantum computing, and accelerating the development of quantum applications with\\nmeaningful impact.\\nFinancial Guidance\\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 30, 2020, and are subject to\\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of\\ngrowth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\\nFirst Quarter 2020 Guidance\\n• Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with\\nfirst quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange\\nrates.\\n• Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter\\n2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the\\nestimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020.\\n• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or\\nlegal settlements are concluded.\\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s\\nfinancial and operating results.\\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of\\nreasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net salesderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\\ninventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial\\nagreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput\\nand productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies,\\nsystem interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many\\nof these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in\\nAmazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K and subsequent filings.\\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information\\nabout us.

    "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at words in isolation, BERT, a transformer based model attempts to use the context of words to get embeddings. BERT uses several concepts of deep learning come up with a model that looks at context in a bidirectional fashion, leveraging information from the entire sentences as a whole through self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose Question is \"How I can cross a road when their is no zebra crossing.\" and this question very similar to query \"How I can cross road on zebra crossing.\" and thier is a chance that above two method give wrong answers but could handle that question. And we don't remove stoping words in the document because if it remove word like in above example \"no\" meaning of whole sentance become change. Bert uses stoping words to make relations between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is Model Fine-Tuning?*\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a big neural network architecture, with a huge number of parameters, that can range from 100 million to over 300 million. So, training a BERT model from scratch on a small dataset would result in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is better to use a pre-trained BERT model that was trained on a huge dataset, as a starting point. We can then further train the model on our relatively smaller dataset and this process is known as model fine-tuning."

Amazon Redshift RA3 instances\\nallow customers to optimize their data warehouse by scaling and paying for compute and storage independently, so\\nthey can choose the number of instances they need based on their data warehousing workload’s performance\\nrequirements, and only pay for the managed storage that they use; AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon\\nRedshift is a new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache that brings compute to the storage layer, so data doesn’t\\nhave to move back and forth between the two, giving customers up to 10x better query performance than other cloud\\ndata warehouse provider; Amazon Redshift Data Lake Export allows customers to export data directly from Amazon\\nRedshift to Amazon S3 in an open data format optimized for analytics; and Amazon Redshift Federated Query lets\\ncustomers analyze data across their Amazon Redshift data warehouse, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Data\\nLake, and Amazon RDS and Aurora databases.\\n• AWS announced a new innovative highly-scalable, cost-saving warm storage tier for Amazon Elasticsearch Service\\ncalled UltraWarm that makes it easier for customers to retain any amount of current and historical log data at up toone-tenth the current cost and is 80% less than the cost of warm-tier storage from other managed Elasticsearch\\nofferings.\\n• AWS announced Amazon Managed (Apache) Cassandra Service, a scalable, highly available, and fully-managed\\ndatabase service that supports Cassandra workloads. Developers can use the same Cassandra application code, Apache\\n2.0 licensed drivers, and tools as they do today to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon Managed Cassandra\\nService without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. And, because it’s serverless, it also\\nremoves the need to provision, configure, and operate large Cassandra clusters, manually add or remove nodes, and\\nrebalance partitions as traffic scales up or down.\\n• AWS announced three new services and capabilities that make it easier for customers to build and operate securely.\\nAmazon Detective analyzes trillions of data points, using machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to\\nmake it easier to visualize and conduct faster and more efficient security investigations; AWS IAM Access Analyzer\\nmakes it simple for security teams and administrators to audit resource policies for unintended access by analyzing\\nhundreds or even thousands of policies across a customer’s environment in seconds, and delivering detailed findings\\nabout resources that are accessible from outside the account; and AWS Nitro Enclaves is a new Amazon EC2\\ncapability that makes it easy for customers in healthcare, financial services, energy, media and entertainment, and\\nother data-intensive industries to process highly sensitive data, like personally identifiable information and intellectual\\nproperty on their compute instances, particularly from internal threats within their own accounts.\\n• AWS announced that customers can start using AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), making it\\neasier for customers to run Kubernetes applications on AWS. AWS Fargate, which provides serverless computing for\\ncontainers, has substantially changed the way developers manage and deploy their containers. Launched two years ago\\nto work with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate has been broadly requested by Kubernetes\\ncustomers. Now, with AWS Fargate for Amazon EKS, customers can run Kubernetes-based applications on AWS\\nwithout the need to manage servers and clusters.\\n• AWS announced three key initiatives as a part of its plans to help advance quantum computing technologies. Amazon\\nBraket is a new, fully-managed AWS service that enables scientists, researchers, and developers to begin\\nexperimenting with computers from quantum hardware providers (including D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti) in a single\\nplace; AWS Center for Quantum Computing will bring together quantum computing experts from Amazon,\\nthe California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other top academic research institutions to collaborate on the\\nresearch and development of new quantum computing technologies; and the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab connects\\ncustomers with quantum computing experts from Amazon and its partners to develop internal expertise aimed at\\nidentifying practical uses of quantum computing, and accelerating the development of quantum applications with\\nmeaningful impact.\\nFinancial Guidance\\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 30, 2020, and are subject to\\nsubstantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of\\ngrowth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\\nFirst Quarter 2020 Guidance\\n• Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with\\nfirst quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange\\nrates.\\n• Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter\\n2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the\\nestimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020.\\n• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or\\nlegal settlements are concluded.\\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at\\namazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s\\nfinancial and operating results.\\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of\\nreasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net salesderived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management\\nof growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,\\ngovernment investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of\\ninventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial\\nagreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput\\nand productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies,\\nsystem interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many\\nof these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in\\nAmazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K and subsequent filings.\\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information\\nabout us.

    "We apply the split method to both our input IDs and attention mask tensors (we don’t need the token type IDs and can discard them). Now we have three chunks for each tensor set.

    "Next, we add the start of sequence [CLS] and separator [SEP] tokens. For this, we can use the torch.cat function, which concatenates a list of tensors. Our tokens are already in token ID format, so we can refer to the special tokens table above to create the token ID versions of our [CLS] and [SEP] tokens. Because we are doing this for multiple tensors, we place the torch.cat function into a for-loop and perform the concatenation for each of our chunks individually. Additionally, our attention mask chunks are concatenated with 1s rather than 101 and 102. We do this because the attention mask does not contain token IDs but instead a set of 1s and 0s. Zeros in the attention mask represent the location of padding tokens (which we will add next), and as [CLS] and [SEP] are not padding tokens, they are represented with 1s.\n",

    "Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to add padding to our tensor chunks to ensure they satisfy the 512 tensorlength required by BERT. Our first two chunks don’t require any padding as they already satisfy this length requirement, but the final chunks do. To check if a chunk requires padding, we add an if-statement that checks the tensor length. If the tensor is shorter than 512 tokens, we add padding using the torch.cat function. We should add this statement to the same for-loop where we add our [CLS] and [SEP] tokens"
